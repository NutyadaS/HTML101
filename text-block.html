    <span>Using p:</span><br>
    <p>First p: the p HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation.</p>
    <p>Second p: but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</p>

    <span>Using: div</span><br>
    <div>First div: the div HTML element is the genetic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS.</div>
    <div>Second div: e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element</div>
    <hr>
    <span>Using: span</span><br>
    <span>First span: the span HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang.</span>
    <span>Second span: It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. span is very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas a span is an inline element.</span>
